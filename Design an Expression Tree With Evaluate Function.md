# 1628. Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function

## Problem Statement

Implement an **Expression Tree** that supports evaluating postfix expressions.

- You are given a list of **strings** representing a postfix expression.
- The expression tree should be built using the given postfix notation.
- Each node in the tree represents an **operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) or an **operand** (integer).
- The tree's root node should return the result when calling `.evaluate()`.

## Approach

1. **Use a stack to construct the expression tree**
    
    - Since postfix notation means operators come **after** operands, we can use a stack to process elements efficiently.
    - When encountering an operand (integer), we push it onto the stack as a `TreeNode`.
    - When encountering an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), we pop the top two nodes from the stack, make them its children, and push the new subtree back onto the stack.
    - The final element in the stack is the root of the expression tree.
2. **Implement a base `Node` class with an `evaluate()` method**
    
    - This interface ensures that each node (whether operator or operand) can be evaluated consistently.
3. **Implement `OperandNode` and `OperatorNode`**
    
    - `OperandNode`: Represents numbers and simply returns its stored value when evaluated.
    - `OperatorNode`: Represents an operator and evaluates its left and right subtrees before applying the operation.
4. **Build the tree using `TreeBuilder`**
    
    - The `buildTree()` method processes the postfix expression and constructs the expression tree.

        left_val = self.left.evaluate()
        right_val = self.right.evaluate()

## Explanation

### **Building the Expression Tree**

Given a postfix expression list like:
["3", "4", "+", "2", "*", "7", "/"]

The construction follows these steps:

1. Push `3` onto the stack â†’ Stack: `[3]`
2. Push `4` onto the stack â†’ Stack: `[3, 4]`
3. Encounter `+`, pop `4` and `3`, create `+` node â†’ Stack: `[+ (3, 4)]`
4. Push `2` onto the stack â†’ Stack: `[+ (3, 4), 2]`
5. Encounter `*`, pop `2` and `+ (3,4)`, create `*` node â†’ Stack: `[* (+ (3, 4), 2)]`
6. Push `7` onto the stack â†’ Stack: `[* (+ (3, 4), 2), 7]`
7. Encounter `/`, pop `7` and `* (+ (3,4),2)`, create `/` node â†’ Stack: `[/ (* (+ (3, 4), 2), 7)]`

The final tree structure:

      (/)
     /   \
   (*)     7
  /   \
(+)     2
/   \
3     4

### **Evaluating the Expression**

The `evaluate()` function is called on the root `/` node:

1. `+` node evaluates to `3 + 4 = 7`
2. `*` node evaluates to `7 * 2 = 14`
3. `/` node evaluates to `14 // 7 = 2`

Final result: **2**

## **Time Complexity Analysis**

1. **Building the tree:**
    - Each token is processed once â†’ **O(N)**
    - Stack operations (push/pop) take constant time â†’ **O(1) per operation**
    - **Total: O(N)**
2. **Evaluating the tree:**
    - Each node is visited once (postorder traversal) â†’ **O(N)**

### **Overall Complexity:** **O(N)**

---

## **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **O(N)** for the stack used during tree construction.
- **O(N)** for storing the expression tree nodes.
- **Total: O(N)**

---

## Conclusion

- The approach efficiently builds an expression tree from a postfix expression.
- The `evaluate()` method correctly computes the result using recursion.
- The solution runs in **O(N) time** and uses **O(N) space**.

This design ensures that the expression tree can handle large postfix expressions efficiently. ðŸš€
