# Understanding the `else` Keyword in Rust

The `else` keyword in Rust is used in conditional statements, such as `if` expressions, to define a block of code that will be executed if the condition in the `if` expression is **false**. It provides an alternative path of execution when the `if` condition is not satisfied.

---

## 🔧 Basic Syntax

```rust
if condition {
    // code block if condition is true
} else {
    // code block if condition is false
}
```

- `if condition`: Specifies the condition to evaluate.
- `{}`: The code block to execute depending on whether the condition is true or false.
- `else`: Defines an alternative block that is executed when the condition is false.

---

## 🧪 Example: Using `else` for Conditional Execution

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 5;

    if number > 10 {
        println!("Number is greater than 10");
    } else {
        println!("Number is not greater than 10");
    }
}
```

> Output:
```
Number is not greater than 10
```

In this example, the condition `number > 10` is false, so the code inside the `else` block is executed.

---

## 📦 Example: Using `else` in Multiple Conditions

You can chain multiple `else` conditions using `else if` to check for more than one possibility.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 15;

    if number < 10 {
        println!("Number is less than 10");
    } else if number == 10 {
        println!("Number is equal to 10");
    } else {
        println!("Number is greater than 10");
    }
}
```

> Output:
```
Number is greater than 10
```

Here, `else if` is used to check for an additional condition, and the `else` block handles all other cases.

---

## 🧳 `else` with `if` in Expressions

Rust allows `if` expressions to return values, and `else` can be used to provide a fallback value if the `if` condition is false.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 5;
    let result = if number > 0 { "Positive" } else { "Non-positive" };

    println!("The number is {}", result);
}
```

> Output:
```
The number is Positive
```

In this example, `else` provides an alternative value when `number > 0` evaluates to false.

---

## ⚙️ `else` with Blocks

You can also use blocks of code in both the `if` and `else` branches, where the blocks are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 8;

    if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("The number is even");
    } else {
        println!("The number is odd");
    }
}
```

> Output:
```
The number is even
```

Here, the `else` block handles the case when the number is odd, as the `if` block checks for even numbers.

---

## 🚪 `else` in Nested `if` Statements

You can also nest `if` statements within `else` to handle more complex conditions.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 20;

    if number > 10 {
        if number % 2 == 0 {
            println!("The number is even and greater than 10");
        } else {
            println!("The number is odd and greater than 10");
        }
    } else {
        println!("The number is 10 or less");
    }
}
```

> Output:
```
The number is even and greater than 10
```

In this example, the nested `if` statement inside the `else` block further refines the conditions based on whether the number is even or odd.

| Feature           | Description                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `else`            | Defines an alternative block of code when an `if` condition is false |
| Multiple `else if`| Used to check multiple conditions sequentially  |
| Conditional Expression| `else` can be used in `if` expressions to provide fallback values |
| Blocks in `else`  | You can use code blocks in `else` just like in `if` |

## ✅ When to Use `else`

- When you need to handle the case where the condition in an `if` statement is false.
- To define fallback behavior for multiple conditions (using `else if`).
- When working with expressions and returning values based on conditions.
