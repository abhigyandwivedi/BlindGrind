# Understanding the `in` Keyword in Rust

The `in` keyword in Rust is used primarily in `for` loops to iterate over elements in a collection, range, or any type that implements the `IntoIterator` trait.

---

## 🧠 What is the `in` Keyword?

The `in` keyword allows you to **iterate** over items in a collection or range in a `for` loop.

```rust
for variable in iterable {
    // loop body
}
```

- `variable`: A pattern that matches each item in the iterable.
- `iterable`: Any type that implements the `IntoIterator` trait (e.g., arrays, vectors, ranges, etc.).

---

## 🔧 Basic Example: Iterating Over a Range

```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("i = {}", i);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
```

- `1..5` is a range from 1 (inclusive) to 5 (exclusive).
- The `in` keyword iterates over each number in the range.

---

## 🔧 Example: Iterating Over a Vector

```rust
fn main() {
    let fruits = vec!["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

    for fruit in fruits {
        println!("I like {}", fruit);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

- `in` is used to iterate over each item in the vector `fruits`.

---

## 🔧 Example: Destructuring in `for in`

You can destructure tuples or other structures directly in the `for` loop:

```rust
fn main() {
    let pairs = vec![(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three")];

    for (num, word) in pairs {
        println!("{} is written as '{}'", num, word);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
1 is written as 'one'
2 is written as 'two'
3 is written as 'three'
```

---

## 🔧 Example: Using `in` with `enumerate()`

You can combine `in` with iterators like `enumerate()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let animals = vec!["cat", "dog", "bird"];

    for (index, animal) in animals.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Animal #{}: {}", index, animal);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Animal #0: cat
Animal #1: dog
Animal #2: bird
```

---

## 🔧 Example: `in` with a String’s Characters

```rust
fn main() {
    let text = "rust";

    for c in text.chars() {
        println!("{}", c);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
r
u
s
t
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes and Limitations

- `in` can **only** be used in `for` loops in Rust.
- It **does not** work as a membership operator like in Python (`if x in list`) — Rust does **not** have this usage of `in`.

To check if an element exists in a collection, use methods like `.contains()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let exists = numbers.contains(&3);
    println!("Does 3 exist? {}", exists);
}
```

### Output:
```
Does 3 exist? true
```

|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `in`    | Iterates over a collection    | `for` loop only   | Cannot be used like Python's `in` keyword |

## ✅ When to Use `in`

- When iterating through collections like arrays, vectors, slices, strings, or ranges.
- When using `for` loops to apply logic to each item in a sequence.
