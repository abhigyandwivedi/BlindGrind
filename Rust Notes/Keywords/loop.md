# Rust `loop` Keyword: An Explanation with Code Examples

In Rust, the `loop` keyword is used to create an infinite loop. A loop created with `loop` will run indefinitely unless it is explicitly broken out of using the `break` keyword. This is useful for scenarios where you need repetitive execution of code and want to control the exit condition inside the loop.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of a `loop` is:

```rust
loop {
    // code to run repeatedly
}
```

The code inside the loop will execute repeatedly until a `break` statement is encountered or some other control flow, like `return`, forces the loop to stop.
## Example: Simple `loop`
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 5 {
            println!("Counter reached 5, breaking the loop");
            break;
        }

        println!("Counter is: {}", counter);
    }
}
```
### Output:
```rust
Counter is: 1
Counter is: 2
Counter is: 3
Counter is: 4
Counter reached 5, breaking the loop
```
In this example, the loop continues to increment `counter` until it reaches 5, at which point the `break` statement is executed, exiting the loop.

## `loop` with `break` and `continue`

- **`break`**: Exits the loop.
    
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.
    

### Example: Using `continue` in a `loop`
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 3 {
            println!("Skipping 3");
            continue; // Skips the rest of the loop and moves to the next iteration
        }

        println!("Counter is: {}", counter);

        if counter == 5 {
            println!("Counter reached 5, breaking the loop");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
### Output:
```rust
Counter is: 1
Counter is: 2
Skipping 3
Counter is: 4
Counter reached 5, breaking the loop
```
In this example, when `counter` is 3, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop iteration, so it does not print `"Counter is: 3"`.

## Returning Values from a `loop`

A `loop` can also return a value. You can place the `return` statement or use `break` to exit the loop and return a value.

### Example: Returning a Value from a `loop`
```rust
fn main() {
    let result = loop {
        let x = 2;
        let y = 3;

        if x + y == 5 {
            break x + y; // Returns the sum when condition is met
        }
    };

    println!("The result is: {}", result);
}
```
### Output:
```rust
The result is: 5
```
In this example, the loop breaks with the value `5`, and the result is printed after the loop.

## Infinite Loops

`loop` creates an infinite loop, which will run forever unless it encounters a `break` or a `return`. This can be particularly useful in cases where you are waiting for a condition to change (e.g., reading input continuously).

### Example: Infinite Loop Waiting for User Input
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    loop {
        let mut input = String::new();

        println!("Enter a number (or 'exit' to quit):");
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");

        if input.trim() == "exit" {
            break; // Exit the loop if user enters "exit"
        }

        let num: i32 = match input.trim().parse() {
            Ok(n) => n,
            Err(_) => {
                println!("That's not a valid number!");
                continue;
            }
        };

        println!("You entered: {}", num);
    }
}
```
### Output Example:
```rust
Enter a number (or 'exit' to quit):
5
You entered: 5
Enter a number (or 'exit' to quit):
exit
```
In this example, the program continuously asks the user to input a number until the user types `"exit"`. If the input is invalid, the loop skips to the next iteration using `continue`.

## Important Notes

1. **Control Flow**: The `loop` provides a simple way to write an infinite loop with manual exit conditions, which is very useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
    
2. **Avoiding Infinite Loops**: Ensure there is always an exit condition inside the loop to avoid unintended infinite loops that could crash your program or cause high CPU usage.
    
3. **Performance Considerations**: Since `loop` is often used for potentially infinite loops, ensure that the code inside the loop is efficient, or the program could become unresponsive or consume excessive system resources.
    

## Conclusion

The `loop` keyword in Rust is a versatile tool for creating loops that run indefinitely, allowing manual control over when the loop should break or continue. Combined with `break` and `continue`, `loop` enables more flexible control flow. You can use `loop` when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code and manage exit conditions or return values dynamically.

It is ideal for scenarios such as repeatedly checking for input, running an infinite game loop, or any other situation where the number of iterations is unknown ahead of time.
