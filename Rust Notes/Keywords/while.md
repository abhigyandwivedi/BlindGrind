# Understanding the `while` Keyword in Rust

The `while` keyword in Rust is used to create a loop that continues to execute as long as a given condition evaluates to `true`. It provides a way to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is no longer met.

---

## ðŸ§  What is the `while` Keyword?

The `while` keyword allows you to perform repetitive actions as long as a specified condition remains true. This makes it useful for cases where you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat a block of code, but you can determine a stopping condition.

---

## ðŸ”§ Syntax of the `while` Loop

The basic syntax for a `while` loop looks like this:

```rust
while condition {
    // code to be executed as long as condition is true
}
```

- `condition`: A boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to `true`, the loop continues. If it evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates.

---

## ðŸ”§ Example: Basic `while` Loop

Here's a simple example where we use a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 1;

    while counter <= 5 {
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);
        counter += 1; // Increment the counter
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The loop will continue as long as the `counter` is less than or equal to 5.
- Each iteration of the loop prints the current value of `counter`, and then `counter` is incremented by 1.
- Once `counter` becomes 6, the condition `counter <= 5` evaluates to `false`, and the loop exits.

### Output:
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Example: `while` Loop with a Conditional Break

You can use a `while` loop with a `break` statement to exit the loop when a specific condition is met, even if the loop condition itself hasn't evaluated to `false` yet.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 1;

    while counter <= 10 {
        if counter == 6 {
            break; // Exit the loop when counter reaches 6
        }
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);
        counter += 1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `while` loop will continue until `counter` reaches 6, at which point the `break` statement terminates the loop early.

### Output:
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Example: Infinite `while` Loop

You can create an infinite `while` loop by using a condition that always evaluates to `true`. However, be careful with infinite loops, as they can cause your program to hang unless thereâ€™s a `break` condition or another way to exit the loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 1;

    while true { // Infinite loop
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);
        counter += 1;

        if counter > 5 {
            break; // Exit the loop when counter exceeds 5
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The condition `true` always evaluates to `true`, so the loop will continue indefinitely unless thereâ€™s a `break` condition inside the loop.
- In this case, the `break` statement exits the loop when `counter` exceeds 5.

### Output:
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Example: Using `while` with `Option`

You can use the `while` loop with an `Option` type to iterate through an option that may or may not contain a value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut option = Some(1);

    while let Some(value) = option {
        println!("Value: {}", value);
        option = if value < 5 {
            Some(value + 1) // Increment the value while it's less than 5
        } else {
            None // Set option to None when value reaches 5
        };
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The loop condition uses a `while let` construct to check if `option` contains a `Some` value.
- The loop continues as long as `option` is `Some`, and the value is printed.
- When the value reaches 5, `option` becomes `None`, and the loop terminates.

### Output:
```
Value: 1
Value: 2
Value: 3
Value: 4
Value: 5
```

| Infinite Loop         | A `while` loop with a condition that always evaluates to `true` creates an infinite loop. |

## âœ… When to Use `while`

- Use `while` when you need to repeat code based on a condition that is checked before each iteration.
- Use `while` with `break` when you need to exit the loop early.
- Use `while let` when working with enums like `Option` or `Result` where you want to iterate based on conditional patterns.
