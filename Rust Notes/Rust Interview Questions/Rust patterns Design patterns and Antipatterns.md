# Rust Development Patterns and Concepts

## High-Level Concepts

### Design Patterns

- **Iterator**: Used to process sequences of elements lazily without manual indexing.
    
- **State Machine**: Models state transitions explicitly to avoid invalid states at runtime.
    
- **Fluent Interface**: Allows chaining method calls for improved readability.
    
- **Builder**: Used to construct complex objects step by step while keeping the code clean.
    
- **Newtype**: A wrapper around an existing type to provide additional type safety and abstraction.
    
- **Observer**: Enables event-driven programming by allowing multiple listeners to react to state changes.
    
- **Reference Object**: Provides a way to use references to shared data safely within Rustâ€™s ownership model.
    

## Patterns

- **Marker Trait**: Traits with no methods used to add metadata to types (e.g., `Send`, `Sync`).
	```rust
	// Marker Trait
trait Printable {}
struct Document;
impl Printable for Document {}
```
    
- **Extension Trait**: Provides additional methods to existing types without modifying them.
	```rust
		 // Extension Trait
		trait Greet {
		    fn greet(&self) -> String;
		}
		impl Greet for String {
		    fn greet(&self) -> String {
		        format!("Hello, {}!", self)
		    }
		}
```
    
- **Struct Tagging**: Attaches metadata to structs using marker traits or enums to enforce correctness at compile-time.
	```rust
				// Struct Tagging
	trait Admin {}
	struct User;
	impl Admin for User {}
	```
    
- **Global State**: Avoids using mutable global state by leveraging thread-safe mechanisms like `Arc<Mutex<T>>`.
		
```rust
// Global State
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
let global_state = Arc::new(Mutex::new(42));
```
    
- **Passing by Value vs. Reference**: Determines ownership and borrowing rules to optimize memory usage.
```rust
fn increment(value: &mut i32) {
    println!("Before: {}", value);
    *value += 1;
    println!("After: {}", value);
}

fn main() {
    let mut num = 10;
    increment(&mut num);
    println!("Final value: {}", num);
}
```

    
- **Error Handling**: Uses `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` enums to manage errors explicitly.
		
```rust
// Error Handling
fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
    if b == 0 {
        Err("Division by zero")
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}
```
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Ensures resource cleanup via `Drop` implementations.
```rust
// RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
struct FileHandler;
impl Drop for FileHandler {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("File closed");
    }
}
```
    
- **Constructors**: Defines idiomatic ways to create objects using `new` or builder patterns.
```rust
// Constructors
struct Person {
    name: String,
}
impl Person {
    fn new(name: &str) -> Self {
        Self {
            name: name.to_string(),
        }
    }
}
```
    
- **Blanket Traits**: Provides trait implementations for a broad range of types using generics.
```rust
// Blanket Traits
trait Displayable {
    fn display(&self);
}
impl<T: std::fmt::Debug> Displayable for T {
    fn display(&self) {
        println!("{:?}", self);
    }
}
```
## Antipatterns

- **`unsafe`**: Should be used sparingly to prevent memory safety issues.
    
- **Deref Polymorphism**: Overuse can make code less explicit and harder to debug.
    
- **Singletons**: Avoided due to potential global state issues and hidden dependencies.
    
- **Too Many Clones**: Leads to unnecessary heap allocations and performance overhead.
    
- **`unwrap()`**: Should be replaced with proper error handling via `expect()`, `match`, or `?` operators.
    

## Idioms and Conventions

- **snake_case for variables and functions**: Rust follows this convention for readability.
    
- **UPPERCASE for constants and globals**: Used to differentiate constants from variables.
    
- **CamelCase for types**: Structs, enums, and traits use CamelCase.
    
- **Preludes**: Modules like `std::prelude::*` provide commonly used imports for convenience.
    

## Language Building Blocks

- **Traits**: Define shared behavior across types and allow for polymorphism.
    
- **Closures**: Inline, anonymous functions useful for functional-style programming.
    
- **Macros**: Used for metaprogramming to generate repetitive code at compile time.
    
- **Generics**: Allow code to be written with type parameters for flexibility and reusability.
    
- **Pattern Matching**: A powerful feature using `match` statements to destructure and process values efficiently.
    

These principles form the backbone of idiomatic Rust development, ensuring efficiency, safety, and maintainability.
